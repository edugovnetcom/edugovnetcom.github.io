      <description>Here we dig into ordinal and cardinal arithmetic a little bit. We also establish the famous result (originally due to Cantor) that |S| &amp;lt; |P(S)|, i.e. that the power set of any set is larger than the set.</description>

      <description>In this entry, we establish more results about ordinals, including proving that every well-ordered set has the order type of an ordinal. We introduce transfinite induction, Cardinality, and use the Axiom of Choice to prove that every set can be well-ordered, among other results.</description>

      <description>In this article we introduce and discuss all of the axioms of ZFC. We introduce Cartesian products, linear and well-orders, and ordinals.</description>

      <description>In the previous entry, we introduced Rings and Fields. In this entry we continue our investigation. We will investigate structures that can be built on top of them. This entry will mostly involve grinding through fundamental proofs that are necessary for more interesting results which will come later.</description>

      <description>In this article we combine some Linear Algebra with a bit of geometry to make some real-world calculations about finding the nearest line to two or more points on a map. We&amp;rsquo;ve also implemented a tool that uses those calculations to fit a great circle to two or more points on the globe. Check it out!</description>

      <description>In this entry we prove that A_n is normal when n &amp;gt;= 5. We then use this result to prove that there is no generalization of &amp;ldquo;even&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;odd&amp;rdquo; permutation to three or more classes &amp;ndash; i.e. there is no class of homomorphisms into Z_n, where n &amp;gt; 2.</description>

      <description>As promised, the last of a three-part series of entries on sorting in parallel. Here we present a parallel implementation of merge_sort which runs in O(nlog_2(n)) time and achieves fairly good parallelism.</description>

      <description>As promised, this is the second entry on parallel sorting. In this entry, we&amp;rsquo;ll implement &lt;code&gt;merge_sort&lt;/code&gt;, and then give two different ways to make it run in parallel. The first one will be a bit simpler than the second one.</description>

      <guid>https://www.edugovnet.com/blog/parallel-sorting-in-theory-and-in-practice-i/</guid>
      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to begin our discussion of parallel algorithms. We&amp;rsquo;ll do this by giving a parallel version of &lt;code&gt;quick_sort_plus&lt;/code&gt;. We finish this entry by extending the &amp;ldquo;Almost the Master Theorem&amp;rdquo; to include cases where f(n) = cn^alpha*log_2(n). In our next entry, we&amp;rsquo;ll introduce &lt;code&gt;merge_sort&lt;/code&gt; as well as a couple different parallel versions of it. We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss both the theoretical and practical runtimes for these functions.</description>

      <description>In this entry, we bring together ideas we&amp;rsquo;ve been developing about permutations, their sign, cycles, and sorting as well as the run time complexity of the algorithms which compute them.</description>

      <guid>https://www.edugovnet.com/blog/finding-the-median-and-an-application-to-sorting/</guid>
      <description>In the previous few entries we&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing quick_sort and analyzing the run-time complexity of recursive algorithms. We&amp;rsquo;re going to apply what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far to finding the median of an array in O(n) time. Then we&amp;rsquo;re going to see how that can be added to quick_sort to guarantee that it finishes in O(nlog_2(n)) time.</description>

      <description>In the previous entry (Sorting, Random Permutations, and little bit of Probability), we introduced &lt;code&gt;quick_sort&lt;/code&gt;, gave a version of it in C++ and started to analyze how many steps it takes to sort a vector of floating point numbers. In this entry, we continue that analysis and prove some results that will help us get a feel for other recursive algorithms.</description>

      <description>In this article we mostly talk about partial orders, and lattices, which are a special type of partial order. We tie it in with our discussions of subgroups before proving two distribution laws for lattices.</description>

      <description>In the previous entry, we gave a laborious proof that a group with an even number of elements has to have an element of order 2. We can do much better than that. We&amp;rsquo;ll show how by proving some famous theorems that were originally due to Sylow.</description>

      <description>We continue our discussion of groups and permutations, breaking down a permutation into disjoint cycles, finding a proper subgroup of even permutations in a group of order 2(2k + 1), and discussing properties of the orbits, stabilizers, fixes, etc&amp;hellip;</description>

      <guid>https://www.edugovnet.com/blog/applying-permutations-to-group-theory/</guid>
      <description>Here we further explore some of the interconnections between groups and permutations on sets. This quickly leads us to some interesting results.</description>

      <description>In the previous entry More Introductory Group Theory, we introduced the definition of a group and also provided some lemmas to help us understand their basic structure a little better. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as thorough as what you&amp;rsquo;d find in most Abstract Algebra books, though. But we did manage to introduce various morphisms, or maps between groups that preserve parts of their structure. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll continue with that theme&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve already introduced some of the topics of Group Theory. In this entry we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about Lagrange&amp;rsquo;s Theorem, various morphisms, and try to tie it back to our ongoing discussion of permutations. We&amp;rsquo;ll also give some examples of groups&amp;hellip;</description>

      <guid>https://www.edugovnet.com/blog/more-math-of-permutations/</guid>
      <description>Here we prove that permutations can be divided into even permutations and odd permutations. We&amp;rsquo;ll also go over what happens when you compose two permutations. Surprisingly, it behaves like adding numbers. E.g. composing an even permutation with an odd permutation results in an odd permutation. Two odd permutations result in an even permutation, etc&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The dot product is so fundamental to linear algebra that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to take for granted that it works. Here we take a quick look at some of it&amp;rsquo;s potential by showing how it can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors.</description>

      <guid>https://www.edugovnet.com/blog/some-of-the-math-of-permutations/</guid>
      <description>A permutation is a function from a set into itself that is both 1 - 1 and onto. You probably know what those terms mean already, but just to refresh, a function is said to be one to one (1-1) if f(x) = f(y) implies x = y.</description>
