      <description>In the previous few entries we&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing quick_sort and analyzing the run-time complexity of recursive algorithms. We&amp;rsquo;re going to apply what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far to finding the median of an array in O(n) time. Then we&amp;rsquo;re going to see how that can be added to quick_sort to guarantee that it finishes in O(nlog_2(n)) time.</description>

      <description>In the previous entry (Sorting, Random Permutations, and little bit of Probability), we introduced &lt;code&gt;quick_sort&lt;/code&gt;, gave a version of it in C++ and started to analyze how many steps it takes to sort a vector of floating point numbers. In this entry, we continue that analysis and prove some results that will help us get a feel for other recursive algorithms.</description>
