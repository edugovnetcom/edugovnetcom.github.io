      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re continuing our proofs of Sylow&amp;rsquo;s Theorems, and also continuing our efforts to count orbits, and determine the size of orbits created by the permutation groups&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>In the previous entry, we gave a laborious proof that a group with an even number of elements has to have an element of order 2. We can do much better than that. We&amp;rsquo;ll show how by proving some famous theorems that were originally due to Sylow.</description>

      <description>We continue our discussion of groups and permutations, breaking down a permutation into disjoint cycles, finding a proper subgroup of even permutations in a group of order 2(2k + 1), and discussing properties of the orbits, stabilizers, fixes, etc&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>A permutation is a function from a set into itself that is both 1 - 1 and onto. You probably know what those terms mean already, but just to refresh, a function is said to be one to one (1-1) if f(x) = f(y) implies x = y.</description>
