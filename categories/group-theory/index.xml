      <description>In this entry we prove that A_n is normal when n &amp;gt;= 5. We then use this result to prove that there is no generalization of &amp;ldquo;even&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;odd&amp;rdquo; permutation to three or more classes &amp;ndash; i.e. there is no class of homomorphisms into Z_n, where n &amp;gt; 2.</description>

      <description>This entry starts out by building to Zassenhaus&#39; Lemma, and finishes by proving the Jordan-Holder theorem about subnormal sequences for finite groups. Enjoy!</description>

      <description>In this article we mostly talk about partial orders, and lattices, which are a special type of partial order. We tie it in with our discussions of subgroups before proving two distribution laws for lattices.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re continuing our proofs of Sylow&amp;rsquo;s Theorems, and also continuing our efforts to count orbits, and determine the size of orbits created by the permutation groups&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>In the previous entry, we gave a laborious proof that a group with an even number of elements has to have an element of order 2. We can do much better than that. We&amp;rsquo;ll show how by proving some famous theorems that were originally due to Sylow.</description>

      <description>We continue our discussion of groups and permutations, breaking down a permutation into disjoint cycles, finding a proper subgroup of even permutations in a group of order 2(2k + 1), and discussing properties of the orbits, stabilizers, fixes, etc&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Here we further explore some of the interconnections between groups and permutations on sets. This quickly leads us to some interesting results.</description>

      <description>In the previous entry More Introductory Group Theory, we introduced the definition of a group and also provided some lemmas to help us understand their basic structure a little better. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t as thorough as what you&amp;rsquo;d find in most Abstract Algebra books, though. But we did manage to introduce various morphisms, or maps between groups that preserve parts of their structure. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll continue with that theme&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve already introduced some of the topics of Group Theory. In this entry we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about Lagrange&amp;rsquo;s Theorem, various morphisms, and try to tie it back to our ongoing discussion of permutations. We&amp;rsquo;ll also give some examples of groups&amp;hellip;</description>
