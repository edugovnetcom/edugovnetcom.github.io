      <description>In this article we combine some Linear Algebra with a bit of geometry to make some real-world calculations about finding the nearest line to two or more points on a map. We&amp;rsquo;ve also implemented a tool that uses those calculations to fit a great circle to two or more points on the globe. Check it out!</description>

      <description>The dot product is so fundamental to linear algebra that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to take for granted that it works. Here we take a quick look at some of it&amp;rsquo;s potential by showing how it can be used to calculate the angle between two vectors.</description>
