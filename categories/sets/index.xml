      <description>In this entry we cover more basic results about ordinal arithmetic. We also prove the so-called &amp;ldquo;Fundamental Theorem of Cardinal Arithmetic&amp;rdquo;, and then we finish with a short discussion about cofinality of cardinals.</description>

      <description>Here we dig into ordinal and cardinal arithmetic a little bit. We also establish the famous result (originally due to Cantor) that |S| &amp;lt; |P(S)|, i.e. that the power set of any set is larger than the set.</description>

      <description>In this entry, we establish more results about ordinals, including proving that every well-ordered set has the order type of an ordinal. We introduce transfinite induction, Cardinality, and use the Axiom of Choice to prove that every set can be well-ordered, among other results.</description>

      <description>In this article we introduce and discuss all of the axioms of ZFC. We introduce Cartesian products, linear and well-orders, and ordinals.</description>
